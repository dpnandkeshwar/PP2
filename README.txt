The client and server programs are labeled as such. Utility.py just contains a single function to XOR to byte
strings. To run this code, simply do "python3 Server.py <true/false>". By adding "true" to the argument, it
will alter the messages such that the HMACs will not be the same and termination will occur. False will allow the
full code to run. Do the same for Client.py as well.
